### Why use this integration?
While you can monitor routers via SNMP or ping trackers, this integration uses native OpenWrt APIs (Ubus/RPC) to provide deep, reliable integration without the overhead of polling generic network protocols. This means instant device tracking via modern ARP/NDP tables, full control over firewall rules and radios, and even the ability to compile firmware directly from your dashboard.

Supports **OpenWrt 25.12** and newer (older versions are supported via `opkg` fallback). This integration natively supports both `apk` and `opkg` package managers, ensuring future compatibility with the latest OpenWrt releases.

## ✨ Features

- **Backup & Commands**: Trigger configuration backups or execute arbitrary shell commands directly from HA.
- **Parental Control & Device Management**:
  - **Internet Access Control**: Per-device "Internet Access" switches to block/allow traffic (Fritz!Box style).
  - **Wireless Management**: WPS control switches and buttons to disconnect specific wireless clients.
- **Smart Tracking & Events**:
  - **Multi-source Device Tracking**: Combines DHCP leases with ARP/NDP tables (`ip neigh`) for instant and reliable presence detection.
  - **Persistent History**: Tracks `initially_seen` and `last_seen` timestamps for every device, persisting across Home Assistant restarts.
  - **Connection Type Detection**: Automatically identifies if a device is connected via `wired` or a specific WiFi band (`2.4GHz`, `5GHz`, `6GHz`).
  - **Topology Mapping**: Wireless clients are automatically linked to their respective Access Point via the `via_device` attribute.
  - **Infrastructure Filtering**: Automatically identifies and filters out the router's own network interfaces to prevent circular self-tracking.
  - **New Device Event**: Fires `openwrt_new_device` when previously unknown MAC addresses are discovered.
- **MQTT Presence Detection (Optional)**:
  - Integration with the third-party [OpenWRT_HA_Presence](https://github.com/f45tb00t/OpenWRT_HA_Presence) scripts.
  - High-performance, low-latency tracking via MQTT events instead of polling.
  - Automatic script deployment and configuration directly from the Home Assistant UI.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > **Randomized MACs**: The "Ignore devices with randomized MAC addresses" option currently **only applies to native device tracking**. MQTT presence detection (via the third-party script) will still track and create entities for randomized MAC addresses if they connect to your WiFi.
- **Advanced Diagnostics**:

## 📦 Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

This integration is fully compatible with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?repository=FaserF/ha-openwrt&category=integration)

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is currently a custom repository. A Pull Request to include it in the HACS default repositories is [already pending](https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/6270).

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Click on the three dots in the top right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add `FaserF/ha-openwrt` with category **Integration**.
4. Search for "OpenWrt".
5. Install and restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/FaserF/ha-openwrt/releases).
2. Extract the `custom_components/openwrt` folder into your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## ⚙️ Configuration

> 🛡️ **Security Note**: Before configuring the integration, please read our [Security Best Practices](SECURITY.md) regarding dedicated accounts, restricting permissions, and connection methods. Using `root` is supported but not recommended.

Adding your OpenWrt router is entirely done via the UI. **No YAML configuration is required.**

1. Navigate to **Settings > Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for **OpenWrt**.
3. Follow the guided setup:
   - Select your connection method: **Ubus (HTTP/HTTPS)** is highly recommended.
   - Enter your router's IP/Hostname, Username (usually `root`), and Password.
   - For Ubus, ensure the `uhttpd-mod-ubus` package is installed on your router.
   - **Secure Provisioning**: If connecting as `root`, the integration will offer to automatically create a dedicated, least-privilege `homeassistant` user and configure all required ACL permissions for you.
   - **Connection Diagnostics**: If setup fails, a detailed diagnostic report will be displayed to help you identify the cause (e.g. firewall blocking, missing packages, or incorrect ACLs).

### Supported Connection Methods

| Feature | **Ubus (Recommended)** | **LuCI RPC** | **SSH** |
|:--- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Performance** | 🚀 Very Fast | 🚄 Fast | 🐌 Slow |
| **Ease of Setup** | ✅ Easy | ✅ Easy | ⚠️ Complex |
| **Permissions** | 🛡️ Strict (ACLs) | 🔓 Permissive | 👑 Full (Root) |
| **Reliability** | ✅ High | ✅ High | ⚠️ Moderate |
| **Device Tracking** | ✅ Instant | ✅ Instant | ✅ Fast |
| **Backups/Update** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ❌ Limited |

#### 🔑 Which method should I choose?
1.  **Ubus (HTTP/HTTPS)**: The gold standard. If your router supports it and permissions are set up correctly, use this. It's the most stable and efficient.
2.  **LuCI RPC**: The perfect fallback. If Ubus is giving you "Access Denied" errors (common on newer OpenWrt SNAPSHOTs or restricted firmware), **switch to LuCI RPC**. It often has more permissive default access to system sensors like temperature and client lists.
3.  **SSH**: Use only if HTTP/HTTPS is not possible or if you need to bypass all RPC restrictions entirely. Note that SSH causes higher CPU load on the router during polling.

### ⚠️ Known Ubus Limitations

When using the **Ubus** connection method, some sensors may be unavailable (showing as 0 or missing) depending on your OpenWrt version and RPC ACL configuration:

- **CPU Usage**: Many OpenWrt releases do not expose CPU statistics directly via Ubus. The integration attempts to read `/proc/stat`, but this is often restricted by default `rpcd` ACLs. If CPU usage stays at 0%, this is likely a permission limitation.
- **System Temperature**: Access to thermal data (e.g., `/sys/class/thermal/...`) is frequently restricted via Ubus. If the temperature sensor is missing, it's due to these security restrictions.
- **Disk/Storage Usage**: Similar to CPU/Temp, detailed filesystem info might be restricted.

**Solution**: If these sensors are vital for you, switch the connection method to **LuCI RPC** or **SSH**, or manually grant `file` read access to `/proc/stat` and `/sys` in your router's `/etc/config/rpcd` or `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/`.

### Required Permissions

If you are using a non-root user (e.g. for security reasons), you need to grant specific OpenWrt permissions (via `rpcd` ACLs or LuCI) to utilize all features of this integration:

| Subsystem | Description | Write Permission Required for |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **System** | Read router info, stats (Hostname, Load, Memory, Temp, Storage) | Rebooting router, sysupgrade, backups |
| **Network** | Read interfaces, bytes/packets counters, speeds | Toggling & reconnecting interfaces |
| **Wireless** | Read WiFi radios, SSIDs, signal levels, client lists | Toggling radios/SSIDs, WPS control |
| **Firewall** | Read firewall rules & port forwards | Toggling rules/forwards, Parental Control (Device Blocking) |
| **Devices** | Read DHCP Leases, ARP/Neighbor table (Connected devices) | Wake on LAN, Kicking wireless clients |
| **VPN** | Read WireGuard & OpenVPN status | - |
| **UPnP** | Read active UPnP/NAT-PMP port mappings | - |
| **SQM** | Read SQM instance status | Toggling SQM, Changing bandwidth limits |
| **Services** | Read active system services (OpenVPN, AdGuard, etc.) | Toggling & restarting services |
| **LEDs** | Read current state of router LEDs | Toggling LEDs, changing brightness |
| **MWAN3** | Read Multi-WAN load balancing status | - |
| **MQTT Presence** | Automatic deployment of presence scripts | Deploying/Updating scripts (requires `file.exec`) |
| **NLBWMon** | Top Bandwidth Hosts sensor — reads per-host traffic via `nlbw` CLI (requires `file.exec` for `/usr/sbin/nlbw`) | - |

During setup, the integration will check your user's permissions and display a summary of available features.

### Required Packages

Some features require additional OpenWrt packages to be installed on your router. During setup, the integration will check if these are installed.

| Package | Missing Features |
|---------|------------------|
| **sqm-scripts** | SQM QoS Settings (Limits, Toggles) |
| **mwan3** | MWAN3 Sensors (Load balancing status) |
| **iwinfo** | Enhanced WiFi Info (Bitrate, detailed signal diagnostics) |
| **etherwake** | Wake on LAN functionality |
| **wireguard-tools** | WireGuard VPN Sensors |
| **openvpn** | OpenVPN Sensors |
| **kmod-batman-adv** | Batman-adv Mesh Support (Kernel module) |
| **batctl-full** | Batman-adv Control (Required for mesh data) |
| **nlbwmon** | NLBWMon Top Bandwidth Hosts sensor (opt-in, requires `file.exec` rpcd ACL) |

### 🛠️ Options Flow

After configuration, click **Configure** on the integration page to adjust performance and tracking behavior.

#### 📡 Device Tracking Settings Explained
You can control how the integration handles network clients (PCs, phones, IoT devices). These settings help you balance detail vs. dashboard clutter.

| Option | Effect when **ON** | Effect when **OFF** |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| **Track network clients** | Creates individual `device_tracker` entities, signal sensors, and control switches (WoL, Internet Access) for every device. | **No individual device entities** are created. Recommended for large networks to prevent Home Assistant database bloat. |
| **Include wired devices** | Tracks every device in the ARP/Neighbor table, including wired PCs and servers. | **Only WiFi clients** are tracked. Ideal if you only care about mobile presence detection. |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Random MAC Limitation**: The "Ignore devices with randomized MAC addresses" option only works for the native device tracking platform. If you enable **MQTT Presence Detection**, the third-party scripts on the router will continue to report all clients, including those with randomized MACs.

> [!TIP]
> **Summary Sensors stay active!** Even if you disable "Track network clients", the **Connected Clients** and **Wireless Clients** sensors will always show the correct total count of active devices on your network.

#### Other Options
- **Update Interval**: How frequently to poll data (default 30s). Adjust based on your router's performance.
- **Consider Home**: Set the grace period (in seconds) for device presence detection (prevents devices from switching to "Away" during brief sleep cycles). Default is 180s.
- **DHCP Software**:
  - `Auto-detect`: Best for most users.
  - `dnsmasq`: Uses `/tmp/dhcp.leases`.
  - `odhcpd`: Uses `ubus call dhcp ipv4leases`.
  - `none`: Disables dynamic IP/hostname resolution to save resources.
- **Custom Firmware Repo**: Provide a GitHub repo (e.g., `owner/repo`) if you use custom OpenWrt community builds to check for updates.
- **Attended Sysupgrade Server**: Configure the URL for the ASU server (default: `https://sysupgrade.openwrt.org`).
- **Enable NLBWMon Top Hosts Sensor** (default: off): When enabled, creates a sensor that ranks the top 5 bandwidth-consuming hosts using the `nlbw` CLI. Requires `nlbwmon` to be installed on the router and `file.exec` rpcd permission for `/usr/sbin/nlbw`. The integration automatically checks for availability at startup and skips entity creation if the binary is not found.

## Firmware Updates

The integration provides a powerful firmware update entity that supports official OpenWrt releases, Snapshot builds, and custom repositories.

### Functionality Matrix

| Feature | LuCI RPC | Ubus (uhttpd) | SSH | Custom Repo (GitHub) |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Check for Official Version** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (uses repo instead) |
| **Check for Snapshot Version** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (via GitHub tags) |
| **Check for Custom Repo Version** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Release Notes** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (GitHub Release page) |
| **Install Official Release** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Install from Custom Repo** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (direct download) |
| **Attended Sysupgrade (ASU)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (not needed) |
| **Automated Backups** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **SHA256 Checksum Verification** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (if `sha256sums` asset exists) |

### Attended Sysupgrade (ASU)

Attended Sysupgrade allows you to generate and install custom firmware images tailored to your specific router and installed packages directly from the UI.

- **Requirements**: The `luci-app-attendedsysupgrade` package must be installed on your router for LuCI/Ubus connections to enable the `Install` feature.
- **Custom Repositories**: If you use a custom OpenWrt fork (e.g. GL-iNet, FriendlyWrt), you can configure a custom ASU URL and repository pattern in the integration options.

### Automated Backups

For maximum safety, the integration can automatically trigger a router configuration backup before any firmware update starts.

- **Storage**: Backups are downloaded and stored locally in your Home Assistant configuration directory under `backups/openwrt/`.
- **Cleanup**: The remote backup file on the router is automatically removed after a successful download.
- **Toggle**: This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled in the integration options.

### Snapshot Logic

The integration automatically detects if your router is running a `SNAPSHOT` build.
- If **SNAPSHOT** is installed: It will search for newer snapshot builds periodically.
- If **Stable** is installed: It will only search for newer stable releases.

### Custom Firmware Repositories (GitHub Releases)

If you use a **custom OpenWrt fork** that publishes firmware via **GitHub Releases** (e.g. [`AgustinLorenzo/openwrt`](https://github.com/AgustinLorenzo/openwrt), or any other community build), you can configure this integration to check for updates from that repository — **without needing a custom ASU server**.

#### How it works

1. **Configure**: In the integration options, set the **"Custom Firmware Repo"** field to the GitHub repository (e.g. `AgustinLorenzo/openwrt` or the full URL `https://github.com/AgustinLorenzo/openwrt`).
2. **Version Detection**: The integration queries the GitHub Releases API and compares the latest release tag against your router's current firmware revision hash (from `release.revision`).
3. **Asset Matching**: It automatically scans the release assets for a `sysupgrade.bin` file matching your router's **target** (e.g. `qualcommax-ipq807x`) and **board name** (e.g. `xiaomi_ax3600`). If a matching asset is found, the **Install** button is enabled.
4. **Checksum Verification**: If a `sha256sums` file is present in the release assets, the integration automatically extracts the correct checksum for your firmware file and displays it.
5. **Release Notes**: The entity links directly to the GitHub release page for full release notes.

#### Custom Firmware Pattern

For advanced users, the **"Custom Firmware Pattern"** option allows you to specify a custom regex pattern to match the correct sysupgrade binary in the release assets. This is useful if the repository uses non-standard naming conventions.

If left empty, the integration auto-generates a pattern based on your router's `target` and `board_name` — which works for most standard OpenWrt forks.

#### Important Notes

> [!NOTE]
> Custom firmware repositories use the **GitHub Releases API** (not ASU). This means:
> - **No custom ASU server is required** — the integration downloads directly from the GitHub release assets.
> - The repository must publish firmware as **GitHub Release assets** (`.bin` files attached to tagged releases).
> - The GitHub API has rate limits (60 requests/hour for unauthenticated requests). Firmware checks happen periodically (every 6 hours by default), so this should not be an issue.

> [!WARNING]
> When a custom repo is configured, the integration will **only** check that repository for updates. Official OpenWrt release checks and ASU are disabled in this mode.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

### "Access Denied" or Permission Errors
OpenWrt's `rpcd` has very strict ACLs. Even `root` is sometimes restricted via the Ubus API.
- **Solution 1**: Switch the connection method to **LuCI RPC** in the integration settings. It uses the same session as the web UI and often has more permissive defaults.
- **Solution 2**: Check `/etc/config/rpcd` on your router and ensure your user has the required scopes.
- **Solution 3**: If you recently upgraded OpenWrt, your ACL files might have been lost. See the entry below.

### Why did my sensors stop working after an OpenWrt upgrade?
If you recently upgraded OpenWrt and noticed that system sensors like CPU, memory, load, or temperature are suddenly showing `0`, `unknown`, or `unavailable`, it is almost certainly because your **RPC ACL rules were reset** during the upgrade.

By default, OpenWrt does not preserve the custom ACL file `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/homeassistant.json` during a sysupgrade unless you have manually added it to `/etc/sysupgrade.conf`.

**How to fix this:**
1.  **Check Repairs**: Look at **Settings > System > Repairs** in Home Assistant. The integration automatically detects missing permissions and offers a **"Refresh Permissions"** fix. Follow the steps and provide your router's root credentials to redeploy the ACLs.
2.  **Options Flow**: Alternatively, go to the integration in Home Assistant, click **Configure**, and check the **"Re-deploy Home Assistant User & ACLs"** option. This will recreate the user and ACL file on your router.
3.  **Manual Check**: If you set up ACLs manually, ensure the file `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/homeassistant.json` still exists on your router and contains the correct permissions.
4.  **Persistent Fix**: To prevent this from happening in the next upgrade, the ACL path should be added to your sysupgrade configuration. **The integration now attempts to do this automatically during user deployment**, but you can also do it manually:
    ```bash
    echo "/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/homeassistant.json" >> /etc/sysupgrade.conf
    ```

### Sensors show "Unavailable"
- Check **Settings > System > Repairs** in Home Assistant. The integration will create a repair issue if there's a specific API or package error.
- Ensure the required packages (like `iwinfo` or `uhttpd-mod-ubus`) are installed.

### How do I use the "Internet Access" switches?
The "Internet Access" switches in Home Assistant act as a toggle for the firewall. When turned off, the router creates a temporary firewall rule to drop all traffic from that specific device's MAC address. This provides simple, reliable parental control without complex VLANs.

### Why are some Signal sensors hidden?
The integration automatically hides "STA-style" sensors (Signal, Quality, Bitrate) if the WiFi interface is in **Master/AP mode**. These values only make sense when the router itself is acting as a client (Station) or Mesh node.

### Does this work with devices behind other Access Points (e.g. Unifi, TP-Link)?
**Yes, absolutely!** A common setup is an OpenWrt router (acting as the main gateway) connected to separate Access Points via LAN cable.

Even if the WiFi on your OpenWrt router is disabled, the integration can still track mobile devices (phones, tablets) connected to those external APs. It does this by monitoring two low-level system sources:
- **ARP/Neighbor Table (`ip neigh`)**: Every device that communicates with the internet or the router itself must appear in the ARP table. The integration identifies these devices and marks them as "Home" as long as they are in an active state (`REACHABLE` or `STALE`).
- **Bridge Forwarding Database (FDB)**: The router's internal bridge/switch learns which MAC address is active on which physical LAN port. This allows the integration to "see" devices even if they haven't sent a packet to the router's IP recently.

From OpenWrt's perspective, these devices will appear as **"wired"** clients, but they will be correctly tracked as individual `device_tracker` entities in Home Assistant.

### Why does it take 10 minutes for my device to show as "Away"?
If your devices are connected via a separate Access Point or Switch, the OpenWrt router doesn't "see" them disconnect. It has to wait for the internal system tables to age out:
1. **Bridge FDB aging**: Usually takes 5 minutes (300s).
2. **ARP aging**: Usually takes another 1-2 minutes to transition to `STALE` and then `FAILED`.
3. **HA Consider Home**: Home Assistant adds another 3 minutes (default) of grace period to prevent flickering.

**How to speed this up:**
In the integration **Options**, you can enable higher precision for presence detection:
- **Trust ARP 'STALE' state**: If disabled, devices that the router hasn't verified recently will be marked as "Away" immediately. This can save several minutes but might cause "flickering" if a device is idle.
- **Trust Bridge FDB**: If disabled, the integration will only rely on active ARP communication. This is the most responsive method but might miss devices that are only talking to other local devices.
- **Consider Home**: Lower this value in the options flow (e.g. to 60 seconds).

### Required MQTT Permissions

To set up and use the MQTT presence detection feature, the OpenWrt user configured in Home Assistant requires the following permissions:

*   **RPC Object `file` / Method `exec`**: Required to deploy the shell scripts, create directories, and manage services.
*   **RPC Object `hostapd.*` / Method `get_clients`**: Required by the script on the router to poll connected clients.

If you are using the `homeassistant` user created by this integration's provisioning script, all necessary permissions (including `file.exec` and access to `/etc/presence`) are automatically granted. If you use a custom user, ensure it has these ACLs configured in `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/`.
